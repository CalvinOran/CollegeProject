                <b>HTML</b> is a hypertext mark-up language. The core of web site creation.
                <br><hr><br>
                <b>HTML</b> was invented by Tim Berners Lee as he created a way for documents to be viewed and shared between computers. He wanted to create a way to allow different formats could be interpreted and viewed on any computer. This led him to create <b>HTML</b>, this was based off an already existing language called Standard Generalized Mark-up Language (SGML). One of the major additions/differences between the two was the use of hyperlinks which allowed different pages to be attached to another page using the ANCHOR element and HREF attribute. Later more additions where implemented and many by the creators of web browsers, this led to the language becoming less define. This is when a group of people decided to collect all the most commonly used tags and publish a document detailing them and called it <b>HTML2</b>. <br><hr><br>
            <b>HTML</b> is a language used to create the structure of a website, working in a top down fashion it sets out the foundation of a website, every site will usually have a header, navigation, content and footer, in that order but sometimes it can differ. The order they are created is the order shown in a website.

                <b>CSS</b> is a cascading style sheet. The core of website design.
                <br><hr><br>
                <b>CSS1</b> released in 1996, supported font, text attributes, alignment of text, tables, images, margin, padding, borders, ID and class.
<b>CSS2</b> released in 1998, supported z-index, positioning.
<b>CSS3</b> released in 2011, added some recommendations: colour, selectors level, namespaces and media queries.
<br><hr><br>
        <b>CSS</b> is a language used to create and change the design of a website, it works in a cascading style meaning the things defined at the top/first are overridden by the things defined below/after it.
